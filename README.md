## Introduction
Welcome to VA8801 Model Zoo. We provide a series of pre-trained models for different application scenarios for you to use, with [Fitipower VA8801 SDK](https://www.fitipower.com/), you can test or inference on these models and easily deploy them to edge computing devices.

VA8801 Model Zoo focuses on providing models trained on VA8801 optimized neural networks, which are tailored to real-world application scenarios and enable faster and more accurate inference on embedded devices.

<br>Standard model format is INT8 tflite.
<br>Using Fitipower Tengen Compiler for VA8801
